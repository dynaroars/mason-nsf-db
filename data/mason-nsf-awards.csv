2439951,CAREER: Encrypted Systems with Fine-Grained Leakage,CNS,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,05/01/2025,01/12/2025,Evgenios Kornaropoulos,VA,George Mason University,Continuing Grant,Anna Squicciarini,04/30/2030,"$367,867.00",,evgenios@gmu.edu,4400 UNIVERSITY DR,FAIRFAX,VA,220304422,7039932295,CSE,806000,"025Z, 1045",$0.00,"Organizations and individuals outsource sensitive data from their own local systems to remote cloud services, making encryption necessary to maintain the privacy and security of the sensitive data. However, to preserve the usefulness of the outsourced data, the goal is to encrypt it so that users can still ask questions about their data without ever decrypting it on the cloud's premises. Current end-to-end encrypted system approaches aimed at addressing this goal have converged to two extremes. In one case, the approaches leak (i.e., reveal) some information about the encrypted data records that are processed in answering a query, which gives a false sense of security since leaks may enable reconstruction of the underlying sensitive information by sophisticated adversaries. In the other extreme, approaches do not reveal any information about the processed data, which requires significantly more computation and makes the overall performance too slow for practical use. The project's novelties are introducing a new paradigm for encrypted systems with carefully constructed, fine-grained leakage that is (1) scalable for practical use and (2) provides rigorous guarantees of protection against the reconstruction adversaries. The project's broader significance and importance are in influencing practical designs and industry practices to create a safer deployment of encrypted systems. The project aims to enhance education by integrating security modules into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum, introducing interdisciplinary courses, broadening student engagement, and expanding pilot programs with local high schools.<br/><br/>This  project introduces encrypted systems with fine-grained leakage and focuses on three interconnected areas: The first explores how specific query and update patterns can nullify leakage, providing provable guarantees of inapproximability or inability to reconstruct against adversarial reconstructions. The second thrust develops cryptographic designs for structured encryption, enabling context-informed leakage profiles that dynamically increase adversarial uncertainty. The third thrust applies this paradigm to concrete real-world scenarios. The research team plans to share project results with industry collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Playing a critical role in holographic communication, immersive content allows viewers to exercise 6-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) motion during playback. Most existing research on immersive content delivery focuses on single-viewer scenarios. This project proposes to enable, for the first time, a large number of co-located viewers over a millimeter wave (mmWave) network that is capable of providing high bandwidth, with a single access point and edge server. It suits numerous use cases such as massive interactive demonstration and immersive classroom education. This project aims demonstrable networking and systems research with a synergy among wireless networking & sensing, multimedia systems, machine learning, and computer vision. It will help bridge the digital divide by reducing the cost of multi-user holographic communication and telepresence. It will also provide a platform to conduct various outreach activities and community services. As streaming emerging multimedia content is playing a key role in the post-COVID world, the project will have a high impact on global societies and economies.<br/><br/>To overcome the challenge of supporting multiple users with limited network and compute resources, this project innovates in three key dimensions. First, it will develop an accurate motion prediction model that captures users' collective motion and their interactions, and study how to adapt to changes deviating from training data. Second, this project will leverage mmWave sensing based on FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous-wave) radar to directly incorporate environment reflection profiles into beamforming and mmWave throughput prediction. Assisted by 6DoF motion prediction, this will lead to proactive and fast beamforming, as well as an accurate forecast of mmWave performance that benefits upper layers. To realize environment profiling based on mmWave sensing, the project will design two techniques: collaboratively reconstructing indoor 3D reflectivity maps and building a neural representation of indoor mmWave reflections. Third, this project proposes two approaches to scale up at the application layer: hybrid streaming where certain viewers receive 3D content and others consume content live-transcoded by the edge, and allowing viewers to share a transcoded view. The team will integrate the above thrusts into a holistic framework, implement it on their mmWave testbed with heterogeneous client devices, and conduct extensive evaluations including field trials with real users.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electrification efforts are transforming this sector, aiming to enhance mobility efficiency, reduce operating and maintenance costs, and cut greenhouse gas emissions. These efforts also seek to boost energy independence and security while significantly contributing to employment, particularly in technology and innovation fields. This shift has already placed more than 2.5 million Electric Vehicles (EVs) on U.S. roads, supported by over 70 thousand charging stations nationwide. To manage this advanced and complex cyberinfrastructure (CI), EV operators and vendors rely on cloud-based EV Management Stations (EVMS), crucial for provisioning services such as charging, billing, and authentication. However, the critical nature of EVMS has made them targets for malicious attacks, often state-sponsored, exploiting rarely investigated vulnerabilities. In response, this project establishes a collaborative ecosystem among academia, industry, and the public sector to bolster the resilience of the EV CI. It aims to develop proactive methodologies to identify and analyze Internet-connected EVMS and their software, thoroughly exploring and mitigating related vulnerabilities. This initiative connects several diverse Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) within the established ecosystem, fostering joint research and providing enriching training opportunities. Through workshops, capstones, curricula material, virtual hands-on labs, professional development, and mentorship programs, the project enhances cross-disciplinary capacities at MSIs and beyond, driving forward the future of resilient, electrified transportation. In this context, this project serves NSF's mission in promoting the progress of science and securing national defense related to this ever-evolving CI.<br/> <br/> <br/>The project pioneers advanced fingerprinting techniques employing automated web scraping, recursive unsupervised learning algorithms, and pattern matching methodologies to identify and cluster Internet-scale EVMS. The primary objective is to detect deployed configurations and their interconnections, while retrieving critical artifacts, such as firmware binaries and compiled software, for comprehensive vulnerability analysis and disclosure. Leveraging robust industry connections, the project acquires auxiliary artifacts, including EVMS source code, through advanced supply chain reconnaissance and reverse engineering methods. This initiative also devises and implements an advanced digital forensic methodology rooted in ensemble techniques and machine learning classifiers. It integrates static analysis, file system forensics, memory forensics using volatility frameworks, data carving with custom heuristics, offensive security tactics, behavioral analysis through dynamic instrumentation, and virtualization methodologies such as hypervisor introspection to meticulously analyze the security posture of EVMS firmware and web endpoints. Furthermore, the project exploits state-of-the-art innovations in Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically identify vulnerabilities in EVMS source code and suggest tailored and sound code fixes. This is accomplished by creating an unprecedented instruction-based training dataset using supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning techniques. Additionally, the project establishes a large-scale data and threat repository to index discovered threat models, associated vulnerabilities, and retrieved EVMS artifacts. Accessible via RESTful APIs and web-based interfaces, this repository democratizes knowledge by making the harvested EVMS assets available at large, significantly empowering EVMS-centric threat situational awareness while fostering advanced research and development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process, known as regression testing, is widely used in software development practice. A major problem in the generation of test cases is the presence of flaky tests:  tests that non-deterministically pass or fail on the same version of the code. Failures from flaky tests can mislead developers about their recent changes, waste developers’ time, and reduce developers’ trust in software testing. Many software development organizations have reported that flaky tests are one of their biggest problems, because they confound assurance goals.   This project aims to improve the reliability and efficiency of regression testing in the presence of flaky tests. It will produce tools that aim to be efficient and effective at resolving the inherent nondeterminism.  The work focuses on (1) reducing the cost of flaky-test detection and debugging techniques by predicting important test properties, (2) developing new techniques to predict flakiness-related properties, (3) speeding up and reducing the resources needed by regression testing, (4) developing new techniques to systematically detect flaky tests, and (5) reducing the flakiness in Android user interface testing. The project will also produce curriculum for education and training on the topic of programming in the face of nondeterminism, and will work with industry to transfer technology. <br/><br/>The research on flakiness will move from the typical, black-box approaches to a new level for detecting, debugging, and fixing through novel, white-box and learning-based approaches. The approach will use static and dynamic analyses to compute state pollution, which may affect test flakiness based on the test execution order. The work involves combinatorial design theory to improve the efficiency of order-dependent test detection. Special attention will be paid to flaky tests in graphical user interfaces using record-and-replay and test input generation.  Test  coverage computations, which can be used to predict whether a code change will affect the test's output, will use a machine learning approach.   The work will result in tool implementations and large-scale evaluations in open source and proprietary environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, today's approaches for interacting with virtual 3D shapes are strictly visual, requiring precise manipulation and interpretation of digital designs on a screen. This project's goal is to create algorithms and interfaces that make 3D modeling easier and more effective, even in the absence of visual cues: auto-correct for 3D drawing, the ability to hear shapes, and the ability to edit 3D shapes verbally. By using senses that do not require a screen—body awareness and sound—this project aims to untether people from their screens, enabling virtual 3D perception from anywhere. The outcomes of this project are expected to have far-reaching impacts, including increased accessibility for people with visual impairments, enhanced interface techniques for low-visibility scenarios, and new opportunities for underrepresented groups in research and do-it-yourself fabrication.<br/><br/>The research focuses on three main objectives: developing accurate “in-air” 3D drawing tools, designing sonification (conveying information through sound) techniques for non-visual shape perception and editing, and creating verbal 3D shape editing tools and interactions. These aims will be pursued through auto-correct algorithms that account for the limits of proprioceptive (a person’s sense of their body pose and movement) accuracy, techniques to sonify shapes based on hand pose, and methods for verbal shape modification.

With the goal of moving towards full autonomy without human drivers, the reliability and safety of these systems are of highest importance. The safe operation of autonomous vehicles depends not only on their physical components, such as sensors and brakes, but also on the proper operation of their autonomous control software and machine learning components. System faults such as transient faults (soft errors) in these components may lead to safety hazards and accidents. This project aims to enhance the safety of autonomous vehicles by thoroughly examining and improving their controller and machine learning components. This project brings classical reliability research methodologies to autonomous driving systems and improves them to understand the reliability behavior of autonomous vehicles with complicated software and hardware. This understanding will be used to identify vulnerabilities (that could lead to hazards) and to improve the reliability of autonomous vehicles. The involved research spans a broad range of theoretical and experimental approaches that are also applicable to other complex cyber-physical systems. <br/><br/>This project will combine model-based and data-driven approaches for end-to-end strategic resilience assessment and multi-level selective resilience enhancement in autonomous vehicles through a holistic focus on temporal and spatial aspects of vulnerabilities within the software and hardware components. The project will start with a spatial vulnerability assessment to pinpoint critical fault locations inside the vast software space in autonomous vehicles, hence accelerating the process of identifying vulnerabilities in their machine learning models and the vulnerable functions and variables in the controller. Meanwhile, temporal vulnerability assessment will be performed to identify the underlying system contexts that are critical in the activation and propagation of faults and safety violations for the purpose of bridging the gap between in-lab reliability assessment and practical system development in the real world. Based on the spatial and temporal vulnerability assessment, the project will explore mitigation techniques through efficient selection protection to enhance the resilience of autonomous driving systems based on the knowledge of spatial and temporal criticality of vulnerabilities to address the challenges of real-time requirements and resource constraints in AVs. The research in this project will be tested and validated through the integration of strategic fault injection and selective protection mechanisms with end-to-end AV testbeds, comprising realistic control software, driving simulators, and safety intervention simulators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

End users report these unexpected results via issue-reporting systems so that software engineers can identify and fix the related defects to improve the quality of the system.  When reporting, users can describe the software problems using natural language or graphical information such as screenshots and videos. Unfortunately, everyday end users are rarely, if ever, trained in reporting software issues. In consequence, they often submit reports that are incomplete or hard to understand, resulting in excessive effort spent addressing the problems, or even the inability for the underlying defects to be identified and fixed. In addition, existing issue-reporting systems are unable to enforce quality standards for reports and fail to provide feedback to the reporters when they submit substandard information. This project will develop a novel-issue reporting system that will allow users to describe software problems interactively, through a dialogue with an automated software agent, rather than writing reports passively, with no feedback and quality assessment.  The software agent will automatically convert the conversations into high-quality issue reports, which will be transmitted to the software engineers. The proposed system will allow software engineers to manage and fix defects faster, leading to higher-quality software systems. The project will also produce and disseminate educational material on best practices in reporting software problems. These materials are intended to be integrated into existing computer-literacy courses at all levels of education.  In addition, the project will focus on recruiting and retaining computer science students from traditionally underrepresented categories.<br/> <br/>The project is centered on three specific goals.  First, it will develop novel techniques for the automated analysis and quality assessment of defect reports. This component will adapt and build upon techniques for automated discourse analysis, dynamic program analysis, and computer vision.  Second, it will improve the quality of issue reports through interactive mechanisms.  This proactive reporting solution will be developed through cross-cutting research on empirical software engineering, human-computer interaction, automated text analysis, and advanced machine learning. This new dialogue-based reporting is expected to become the standard method by which many kinds of software issues will be reported. Finally, the project will develop more efficient and effective techniques for automated defect reproduction and duplicate detection, leveraging the high-quality reports created via the interactive reporting system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When build issues arise, developers often have to manually analyze CMake scripts to determine how files or libraries are built. This manual process is both error-prone and time-consuming. This project will develop Cybolic, a formal method and tool to analyze CMake. The novelties of the project are the automated and scalable algorithms enabling Cybolic to be practical and useful for developers. The project's impacts are that the open-source Cybolic tool will improve the debugging and build process of software relying on CMake and will benefit users who currently have to manually analyze CMake scripts.<br/><br/>The project will build the Cybolic as a symbolic execution technique that transforms CMake code into logical formulae representing build conditions, which are mappings of conditions over build options for files and compilation flags. These build conditions can help developers in many tasks, such as finding orphan code sections, files, or compilation options that are never used and determining what patches or code changes affect a compilation configuration. This project will focus on (i) making Cybolic scale to large and complex CMake-based projects, (ii) applying Cybolic to detect real-world build issues, (iii) and integrating Cybolic with popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio (VS) Code to improve its usability and adoption.

Yet, we know surprisingly little about what these models capture in their learned representations, why they perform well on some tasks and not on others, and how they can produce deep insight into the relationships describing the biological space.

It also aims to do so in a way that is resource-aware, sustainable, and accessible to all researchers. The research activities are organized in three thrusts: (1) encoding prior biological knowledge in PLMs for joint and resource-aware learning in composite spaces, (2) revealing fundamental properties and organizing the learned representation space to inform and connect what is captured with properties of interest, and (3) enabling PLMs to capture diverse contexts for deeper exploration of the structural, functional, and evolutionary organization across protein space.

Quantum learning, a combination of quantum computing and machine learning and also known as Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA), is one of the most promising approaches to be applied to a variety of practical problems. Quantum learning is a hybrid quantum-classical protocol that optimizes parameters in a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) with a cost function using a classical training optimizer. However, the inherent noise on quantum devices brings severe deployability and portability issues, making the optimized VQCs suffer significant performance degradation in deploying or porting among different quantum computers. What is more, the noise on the quantum devices changes over time, known as unstable noise, fluctuating noise, or drift of noise, which prevents the reuse of VQCs on one quantum computer at different times and even misleads the learning to a non-optimal path when noise change during the VQC training process. This project aims to enable temporal-reliable quantum learning by generating fundamental understandings and practical approaches in quantum learning, uncertainty prediction, noise suppression, and system visualization. Outcomes are evaluated using quantum learning for scientific applications on the DoE-sponsored supercomputing centers that provide access to various commercial quantum computing resources. <br/><br/>With the objective of facilitating practical quantum learning, this project uses a systematic and innovative approach to develop an integrated framework, which presents the novelty of the proposed research, practical value, and domain impacts: (1) developing a novel compression-based error adaptor to adjust the parameters and structure of VQC according to the fluctuating quantum noise, such that the VQC can effectively and efficiently adapt to the present quantum noise; (2) building an uncertainty predictor to quantify the deployability of a given pair of VQC and quantum processor, such that users can be aware of performance change; (3) designing a novel visualization tool with scalability to portray the impact of noise on the performance of a given VQC; and (4) the developed toolset is finally integrated into a scientific application, real-time earthquake detection, which can provide insights into identifying real-world tasks where quantum technologies may offer a promising solution. The education impacts of this project include the tutorials on the developed software tools to guide and encourage the domain researchers to leverage the advanced quantum computing cyberinfrastructure; the integration of research to the quantum summer program from the Potomac Quantum Innovation Center for high school seniors; and the development of new undergraduate and graduate courses for quantum workforce training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As most visual inference algorithms leverage the color and brightness of images, the use of polarization in computer vision has not yet reached its full potential. This CAREER project will study how the way surfaces reflect polarized light can be used to help recognize objects more effectively. The project will address the following two questions: How does the polarization of light change after interacting with various types of surfaces? What can polarized light tell us about the kinds of objects that it has interacted with? Addressing these questions can lead to significant improvements in machine vision systems by strengthening their capability to do geometric and semantic scene understanding in which shapes are described and named. This project will result in new polarization-based vision systems for autonomous navigation and smart manufacturing. It will also produce novel solutions to the challenging problems of imaging and sensing through scattering media, including water, fog, haze, clouds, and bodily tissues.<br/><br/>This project will investigate polarimetric light transport and tackle the problem of polarimetric visual understanding through analysis by synthesis. The research team will derive theoretical models for polarimetric surface reflectance and volumetric light transport, design visual inference algorithms for scene understanding, and develop computational imaging systems for real-world data acquisition. Specifically, the project will first study the transfer of polarization state upon local surface interactions. Physics-based layered material models will be adopted for characterizing complex surface scattering effects beyond direct mirror reflection. The project will then study the transport of polarized light through a spatial volume. A bottom-up approach will be taken to develop a voxel-based light transport model to mitigate the ill-posed transport matrix decomposition problem. The project will also study the challenging scenarios of turbid media, which could result in new techniques for imaging through scattering media. Leveraging the polarimetric light transport models, visual inference algorithms will be designed and developed for understanding scene properties, such as depth, shape, reflectance, and semantic composition. This project will develop novel computational imaging systems for acquiring real-world data to validate and analyze our proposed models and algorithms. A high precision polarimetric reflectance of various surfaces will be collected in this project and shared with the research community.

However, just like traditional software, DNNs can have ""bugs"" and be attacked. This naturally raises the question of how DNNs should be tested, validated, and ultimately verified to meet the requirements of relevant robustness and safety standards. To address this question, researchers have developed powerful formal methods and tools to verify DNNs.  However, despite many recent advances, existing approaches and tools still have challenges in achieving good precision and scalability. Moreover, they could produce unsound results and do not apply to DNNs such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This project aims to address these challenges. The project's novelties are the integration of learning and abstraction ability in modern constraint solvers for accurate and scalable DNN verification, stress-testing DNN verifiers and certifying their results, and tackling GNNs through the lenses of other DNN approaches. The project's impacts are the development of new theories, advanced methods, and practical tools to ensure the accuracy and quality of DNN systems.<br/><br/>The project has four technical research components. The first component develops NeuralSAT, a constraint-solver for DNNs that combines the conflict-driven clause learning ability of modern SAT solving and abstraction-based theory solver in SMT solving.  The second component makes NeuralSAT more precise and efficient at scale by developing non-convex abstractions and leveraging heuristics and optimizations in modern SAT solvers. The third component uses clause learning and metamorphic testing to help developers find bugs in their DNN verifiers during production and certify their results during deployment.  The fourth component explores GNNs, a powerful model in deep learning but with few existing formal techniques and tools by reducing GNN to Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN), which allows for the applications of FNN analyzers to GNNs. The project will benefit society by improving the reliability of systems embedding DNNs.  The research contributes to ML by developing effective techniques to verify DNNs, allowing AI/ML researchers and users to improve their DNNs and deploy them with confidence.

This proposal aims to create a new representation of human identity based on the analysis of sweat through hyperspectral imaging (HSI), which enables further research to explore sweat as a solution for efficient, accurate, and secure biometric human identity verification. Sweat can provide a meticulous perspective on identity by incorporating chemical properties of a biometric trait.

To accomplish this objective, this project focuses on confirming that metabolites can be extracted from sweat excreted from human fingertips, confirming their reproducibility, and creating an HSI reference for each metabolite of interest. Due to diversity in the sensing approach, spectral references obtained through traditional spectroscopy for sweat metabolites cannot be used as HSI reference.

Despite this, these predictive capabilities are rarely adopted by public health decision-makers to support policy interventions. One of the issues preventing their adoption is that AI methods are known to amplify the bias in the data they are trained on. This is especially problematic in infectious disease models which leverage available large and inherently biased spatiotemporal data. These biases may propagate through the modeling pipeline to decision-making, resulting in inequitable and ineffective policy interventions. This project investigates how the AI disease modeling pipeline can lead from biased data to biased predictions and to derive solutions that mitigate this bias in three aims: 1) creating an AI system to predict the spread of emerging infectious diseases in space and time, 2) simulating a population from which we will collect data often used as input for AI systems in a way that the bias is controlled, and 3) exploring links between bias in the collected data and the resulting bias in the AI model and deriving solutions for their mitigation. The project will enable AI-driven infectious disease models and predictions that will support fair and equitable decision-making and interventions. The project will enrich education and training related to ethical AI practices and will support professional development opportunities for early-career researchers, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in the United States and Australia.  <br/><br/>In Aim 1, the team of researchers will use a self-supervised contrastive learning approach that uses mobility prediction as a pre-text task to learn representations of spatial regions. These representations can be used for infectious disease spread prediction given only very little infectious disease ground truth data. The investigators hypothesize that such a model is susceptible to data bias. Thus, in Aim 2, the team of researchers will leverage a large-scale agent-based simulation that will serve as a sandbox world for which we have perfect knowledge of and from which we can collect data and inject various types of bias. For Aim 3, the team of researchers will investigate how different types of simulated data bias leads to biased AI predictions by leveraging different metrics of fairness in AI and studying how these fairness measures can be incorporated into the AI optimization procedure to mitigate bias. By understanding, measuring, and mitigating bias inherent to traditional AI solutions, the project will enable accurate, scalable, and rapid predictions to support fair and equitable decision-making for pandemic prevention.<br/><br/>This is a joint project between researchers in the United States and Australia funded by the Collaboration Opportunities in Responsible and Equitable AI under the U.S. NSF and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellites, and reconnaissance cameras lack stereo information causing 3D reconstruction and depth estimation to fail.  Turbulence caused by air and water also causes light rays to deflect from their original path and introduces noticeable motion artifacts like blurriness and distortion.  This project develops a generalizable motion field estimator using neural networks coupled with specific hardware settings to enhance computer vision tasks in long-range imaging. Successful development of such a motion field estimator can enable applications of computer vision systems at long distances and/or under turbulent environments including UAV navigation, object tracking and detection, and long-range monitoring.

This research is motivated by the observation that turbulence-induced motion fields can provide depth and sub-pixel color information, which is crucial in restoring scenes with high-frequency details. To achieve this goal, the project will pursue three research thrusts: 1) neural field decoupling of object and turbulence motion; 2) reconstructing turbulence strength and flows from passive visual imagery; and 3) motion field guided intelligent foveation for long-range imaging. The first thrust will develop algorithms for estimating and recovering motion fields with both object and turbulence motion by investigating physics-based velocity fields. The second thrust will develop tractable quantitative turbulence motion models that can be applied to both air and water environments using deep neural networks. The third thrust will integrate the turbulence motion field into different visual computing pipelines to benefit long-range computer vision tasks. This project will collect a large motion field dataset with true turbulent parameters of different media types and turbulence strengths, which can facilitate the development of data-driven machine learning algorithms for long-range computer vision.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main contribution is SpaceNet, the first-of-its-kind, fully open-source HIL space network testbed that is able to emulate a fast-changing network topology with changing connectivity and latencies, challenging routing, transport protocols, and re-architecting applications.<br/> <br/>The testbed will uniquely support multiple networks of distributed heterogeneous platforms in multiple domains, addressing challenges in adaptive communications for multi-constellation coexistence, emulating what has been called the “internet of space things”. Direct connectivity allows for the exploration of how satellites and constellations might interconnect without revealing proprietary information of each constellation, creating the equivalent of interdomain routing for space networks. Additional capabilities examine behavior in the face of disruptions such as large solar storms. Achieving these new capabilities requires merging lab-based spacecraft hardware with a large-scale state-of-the-art wireless radio testbed to create more flexible and higher fidelity rendering of the satellite links, resulting in a networked HIL development and a testing environment that accurately models the network and dynamics; routing and re-routing data link tables on the fly, scaled to multiply-redundant algorithms and architectures; satellite-like lab hardware for testbed nodes; and virtual nodes and remote access for government, industry, and academic researchers.<br/> <br/>The expected outcome is a remotely-accessible, multi-domain network and cybersecurity research infrastructure, and a validated first-of-its-kind adaptive and assured space network communications emulator. In addition, students will be involved in class projects covering technical concepts on space communications, TN/NTN co-existence, and hands-on experiences with SpaceNet.

Unlike traditional videos and 360-degree videos that are two-dimensional (2D), every frame in a volumetric video consists of a three-dimensional (3D) scene or object represented by a 3D model such as a point cloud or a polygon mesh. The 3D nature of volumetric video enables viewers to move with six degrees of freedom, leading to a truly immersive viewing experience. However, compared to conventional videos, streaming volumetric videos over the Internet faces unique challenges: a lack of precise motion tracking, extremely high bandwidth consumption, a lack of quality-of-experience (QoE) models, and complex interactions among network, computation, and motion. This project proposes a holistic research agenda addressing the above challenges through four core approaches: multi-dimension, multi-modality motion sensing and prediction; deep-learning-based content upsampling; comprehensive QoE modeling; and resource/motion adaptation. The project aims at demonstrable systems and networking research with a synergy among multimedia systems, networking, wireless sensing, machine learning, computer vision, and graphics. The research team will develop prototypes and evaluate them in real-world settings. <br/><br/>Internet video streaming is playing a key role in today's world, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a key enabler of immersive telepresence, volumetric content will become popular in the near future. The techniques developed from this project will significantly reduce network resource usage and improve the user experience for volumetric content delivery over the Internet. This will benefit both producers and consumers of volumetric videos, as well as boost their applications in various domains such as education, telehealth, manufacturing, and entertainment, ultimately leading to a high impact on societies and economies.

The objective of this research is to build novel binary code analysis approaches and techniques based on recent advances in deep learning to achieve both high accuracy and scalability. This project will not only advance cross-architecture binary code analysis, but also propel its applications in vulnerability discovery, plagiarism detection, and malware understanding, especially in the context of heterogeneous IoT devices.

The technical aims of the project are divided into three thrusts. First, inspired by Neural Machine Translation, instructions and basic blocks are represented as embeddings (i.e., high-dimensional vectors), just like NMT represents words and sentences as points in high-dimensional spaces to facilitate further handling. Second, the captured code semantics at the instruction and basic-block layers are used for analysis at the control flow graph level. The layered learning process fits the hierarchy of semantics inherent in code from instructions, basic blocks, to control flow graphs. Thus, it minimizes the loss of semantic information and keeps scalable.

The research advances secure and usable IoT authentication under constraints. Unlike many prior works that build authentication on proximity, which can be exploited by wireless attacks, the project's novelty is based on physical operations that cannot be spoofed by an attacker.

In 2021, the U.S. grain export accounted for over 40% share of international grain trade. Millions of U.S. farmers depend on international market for living and prosperity. However, the U.S. grain export is not only facing tough competition from other export countries, but also impacted by grain yield in import countries. In order to gain the competitive edge, stakeholders need to know as early as possible where and how many acres each type of crops that have been planted in a growing season around the world so that yield can be estimated, production and demand balance can be assessed, and grain prices can be predicted. This requires generating in-season crop maps of both U.S. and foreign countries. The classic method to generate in-season crop maps needs a large amount of verified information on crops (i.e., ground truths) to train algorithms for classifying in-season satellite remote sensing images. However, it is difficult or even impossible to obtain ground truths in foreign countries, particularly in early season. This study proposes to develop a spatiotemporally transferable machine-learning algorithm which will be trained with U.S. data and applied to in-season satellite remote sensing images of foreign countries for creating the in-season crop maps of the countries. Success of this project will make the in-season crop mapping of foreign countries possible. The project will significantly enhance the competitiveness and profitability of U.S. agriculture, increase the food security of the world, and potentially bring billions-of-dollars economic benefits to U.S. farmers.<br/><br/>Satellite remote sensing with ground truth tagging is the current practice for crop mapping. However, it suffers from two problems: 1) Unavailability of ground truth in foreign countries; 2) Spatiotemporal intransferability of trained classifiers. This study will design spatiotemporally transferable learning algorithm and temporal learning strategy that would maximally transfer label data and models from U.S. to foreign countries. The proposed method utilizes adversarial training and contrastive learning. Through this two-player game, the feature extractor produces domain-invariant features. A classifier trained on this domain-invariant representation can transfer its model to a new domain because the target features match those seen during training, thus bridging the gap between times and locations. The U.S. trained algorithm will be tested in Canada and Brazil to demonstrate its cross-country and cross-hemisphere transferability. Scientifically this project will advance landcover science in in-season crop mapping by offering a novel method of transfer learning, advance machine learning in unsupervised domain adaptation across both space and time, and offer new methods to derive spatiotemporally invariant features from time-series remote sensing images. Socioeconomically this project will enhance competitiveness and profitability of U.S. agriculture, increase food security of the world, and potentially bring billions-of-dollars benefits to U.S. farmers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, much of their work focuses on community risk reduction (CRR), a paradigm that seeks to mitigate risks before they lead to emergencies in the first place. The CRR paradigm will leverage new data-driven risk prediction and management (DDRPM) tools to predict and respond to a variety of community risks. Yet, designing DDRPM tools to realize this vision requires deep understanding of current work practices, and the potential future impacts of such tools on labor (e.g., increased data work), workers (e.g., decreased autonomy), and communities (e.g., intensified surveillance of marginalized populations). Understanding the intersection of sociotechnical work practices for handling risks and the design of data-driven computational tools requires fundamental human-centered computing research. The fire service is key to the health, safety, and security of individuals, communities, and society; thus, this research is primed to provide lasting, practical benefits. This project will directly benefit the study sites and the populations they serve since insights drawn from ethnographic research will be disseminated to study sites and participants.<br/> <br/>This project has multiple goals: (1) comprehensive empirical exploration of community-oriented risk work performed by fire personnel and their associated data work, (2) development of a human-centered design process for the future of DDRPM tools, (3) co-designing speculative DDRPM tools with fire departments, and (4) developing a sociotechnical theory of risk work. It will achieve these goals in three phases. First, it will document current practices of community-focused risk work and community data resources using in-depth ethnographic research in three fire departments. The ethnographic data will be leveraged as part of a novel human-centered design process that combines ethnography, inquiry through design, participatory design, and speculative design. Second, the team of researchers will co-design speculative prototypes for DDRPM in partnership with the study participants. This methodological approach will fill a crucial gap in research and design of sustainable data-driven tools for risk handling by enabling consideration of impacts of design of DDRPM tools on future work practices in the fire service and on communities. Third, the team will evaluate the resulting speculative prototypes to understand how they shift visions of technologically-supported community risk work for the fire service. Both the design process and the co-designed prototypes will be disseminated to the fire service professional community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monitoring videos captured by remote cameras are typically live streamed to servers for analysis because of the limited computational capabilities of camera devices. From wildlife tracking and coastline event detection to airport suspect recognition and victim search in disaster response, such automated video analytics systems have been deployed widely to assist human operators. The recent advancement of 360 degree cameras enables a new paradigm of panoramic video analytics that can cover the 360 degree surroundings of a monitoring site and can address the errors in and missing analysis abilities of traditional 2D video analytics. However, realizing this vision requires live streaming massive panoramic video data to servers for online analytics, which cannot be supported by the current cyberinfrastructure (CI). The mismatch between the 360 degree video bit rate and available network bandwidth can cause lagging or failed analysis, diminishing the benefits of panoramic video analytics. This project will create a framework of video compression, streaming, and recovery for achieving the vision of panoramic video analytics in science and engineering monitoring. The new CI will allow scientists and engineers to conduct online panoramic video analytics and enable innovative applications that are otherwise unattainable. The research outcomes will support the development of a remote learning tool for imaging analytics, course curriculum and undergraduate research in media computing, and educational videos for public outreach.<br/><br/>This project investigates a machine centered video computing framework in order to enable online panoramic video analytics. Unlike traditional human centered video frameworks where pixels are processed to preserve extensive aesthetic details for human viewing, the proposed CI compresses, streams, and recovers feature points for machine analytics. Because of this fundamental change, the proposed framework is able to greatly outperform legacy video CIs and support panoramic video analytics. To this end, a deep learning based 360 degree video codec will be built to distill the spatiotemporal characteristics of video features and optimize both compression ratio and analytics accuracy. Second, an adaptive 360 degree video bitrate streaming system will be designed to ensure continuous delivery of full 360 degree video frames by prioritizing regions of interest preferred by machines. Third, a 360 degree video recovery scheme will be developed to restore noisy and delayed video data while considering the time constraints in the online analytics models.

Unfortunately, modern static analyses are still limited in handling complex program semantics that often appear in many real-world applications: they support only simple properties, produce false positives, or do not scale to large programs. Recent dynamic or ""data-driven"" approaches address several shortcomings of static analyses to analyze more complex program properties more efficiently, yet sometimes yield incorrect results. The project's novelties are the theoretical and practical integration of static and dynamic approaches to analyze, localize, and repair temporal aspects of reactive/interactive systems.

Kidney transplantation is the definitive, gold standard treatment that provides the best quality of life for end-stage renal disease patients. The treatment, however, is not accessible to many due to constraints such as blood type or human leukocyte antigen tissue type incompatibility between transplant candidates and their kidney donors. To overcome these incompatibilities, the transplant community has devised several novel schemes including KPD and desensitization. KPD allows patients with a willing - but incompatible - living donor to swap their incompatible donor with a more compatible donor, also in the KPD donor-patient pool, while the desensitization procedure removes antibodies from transplant recipients’ blood streams prior to surgery to reduce the risk of potential rejection of donated kidneys. Currently, both of these schemes have limitations. To overcome the limitations, prominent transplant experts have been advocating for combining the two schemes. This project aims to develop stochastic simulation and optimization-based algorithms for matching donors and recipients in a KPD system with desensitization therapy. In contrast to a conventional KPD system where transplant candidates simply swap their incompatible donors for more compatible donors in the system, the envisioned KPD systems would offer patients the additional option of undergoing a personalized desensitization therapy along with the option of swapping donors to significantly increase their likelihood of a match. <br/><br/>The research objective is to develop an integrated dynamic stochastic simulation-optimization model comprised of: (i) an optimization strategy to identify the optimal personalized protocol for desensitization; (ii) improved robust/stochastic optimization methods to integrate the desensitization therapy into the KPD matching; and (iii) a decision-support tool to help patients decide whether to accept the desensitization regimen with a less compatible kidney, or wait for a more compatible one. The output of the integrated dynamic stochastic simulation-optimization model will include the suggested paired matchings from the combinatorial and simulation optimization algorithms, the realized matchings based on simulated patient behavior, and statistical estimates of key performance system metrics.

By ignoring other varieties, treating them essentially as statistical noise, current technologies neglect the millions of people who speak these varieties. <br/><br/>This project is creating ways to enable language technologies such as translation and question-answering systems, both to process and to generate fine-grained language varieties. The team will develop computational methods to automatically recognize features of different language varieties and then create approaches for integrating such linguistic information into the models powering language technologies. Additionally, the team will design methods to adapt models into varieties for which minimal training data may be available. The resulting suite of general methods will benefit diverse communities and less-privileged populations that speak underserved languages and varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An unprecedented amount is being collected in diverse applications such as healthcare systems, the Web, cyber network monitoring, self-driving cars, and Internet-of-Things services. While deep learning has achieved enormous success in time series predictive analysis, a key bottleneck of such models is that they are ignorant about the uncertainties in their predictions. A consequence is that they can produce wildly wrong predictions without noticing---this will lead to misguided decisions, which can be catastrophic in life-critical applications. This project aims to remedy this issue and advance deep learning towards more trustworthy time series analysis. The project will enable principled deep learning models for uncertainty-aware and reliable time series regression and classification without sacrificing their predictive power. Research findings from the project will be incorporated into graduate-level classes, tutorials, and workshops to bring multiple stakeholders and domain scientists together.<br/><br/>The technical aims of this project are divided into three thrusts. First, the project will develop novel techniques bridging deep sequential models (e.g., recurrent networks, transformers) with Gaussian processes to quantify uncertainty in the functional space. Second, the project will explore how to learn calibrated deep sequential models and how to further decouple different sources of uncertainties to understand where a model's predictive uncertainty comes from. Third, the project will harness uncertainty to improve the reliability and efficiency of time series predictive systems. These techniques will enjoy the representation power of deep neural networks for modeling complex temporal dependencies in time-series data, while providing principled methodologies for quantifying and leveraging uncertainty for robustness and performance. The developed new models, algorithms, and techniques will be deployed in two important applications for times series analysis: 1) public health monitoring and forecasting, and 2) real-time analysis for mobile sensing time series data. The developed tools will also be open-sourced for trustworthy time series analysis that can benefit many other applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast, human interaction with the world is based on experience, learning and reasoning on qualitative factors, including spatial concepts, such as near/far, behind, next to, inside. Considering how spatial information is conveyed in natural language, there is no unique mapping between the spatial expressiveness and quantifiable spatial concepts. For the most part this is attributed to the highly contextualized nature of human language; that is, what human language is interpreted in part by who and where it was said and what other words surrounded the comment. The challenge in this project is on devising means to better understand people's perception of space by deciphering such spatial language terms. This will lead to novel text and audio-based interfaces for the consumption of geospatial data such as when asking for or giving directions in a way that is intuitive to people or for systems that more effectively assist the visually impaired.<br/><br/>The technical aims of the project are divided into two thrusts. The first thrust develops a simulation to crowdsource geospatial language expression data by having users interact in a virtual environment. The spatial language expressions and interactions are captured using quantitative models. The second thrust then uses these user-generated descriptions to evaluate several modeling approaches that include (i) studying specific urban settings to identify contextual factors and (ii) exploring neural approaches to modeling the problem of grounding language to this spatial context. The resulting models can then be used to automatically translate language to geospatial information and, in the reverse direction, to train dialogue agents that can generate enriched, contextualized route and scene descriptions with natural, useful geospatial language expressions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, advances in AI come at a considerable resource costs. To reduce the cost of AI, this project takes inspiration from biological systems. It is well-known that a key bottleneck in AI is the perception subsystem. It is the part that allows AI to perceive and understand its surroundings. Humans are very good at understanding what’s critical in their environment and the human perceptual system automatically focuses limited cognitive resources on those elements of the scene that matter most, saving a significant amount of “brain processing power”. Current AI pipelines do not have a similar mechanism, resulting in significantly higher resource costs. The project refactors data analytics and machine intelligence pipelines to allow for better prioritization of external stimuli leveraging and significantly extending advances in scheduling previously developed in the real-time systems research community. The refactored AI pipeline will improve the efficiency and efficacy of AI-enabled systems, allowing them to be safer and more responsive, while at the same time significantly lowering their cost. If successful, the project will help bring machine intelligence solutions to the benefit of all society. This is achieved through interactions between research, education, and outreach, as well as integration of multiple scientific communities, including (i) researchers on embedded computing who offer platforms and schedulers, (ii) researchers on IoT and networking, and (iii) researchers on intelligent applications and application domain experts. The work is an example of cyber-physical computing research, where a new generation of digital algorithms learn to exploit a better understanding of physical systems in order to improve societal outcomes.  <br/><br/>The project removes systemic priority inversion from machine intelligence pipelines in modern neural-network-based cyber-physical applications. In general, priority inversion occurs in real-time systems when computations that are less critical (or with longer deadlines) are performed ahead of those that are more critical (or with shorter deadlines). The current state of machine intelligence software suffers from significant priority inversion on the path from perception to decision-making, resulting in vastly inferior system responsiveness to critical events, thereby jeopardizing safety and increasing the cost of hardware to meet application needs. By resolving this problem, this project shall improve system ability to react to critical inputs, while at the same time significantly reducing platform cost. The intellectual merit of the project lies in investigating the intersection of two core areas in cyber-physical computing: (i) data analytics and machine learning and (ii) real-time systems. Specifically, the project refactors data analytics and machine intelligence pipelines to remove priority inversion. Mitigation of priority inversion problems in different systems has been one of the key contributions of the real-time community. Removal of priority inversion from machine intelligence pipelines makes several other scientific contributions. Namely, (i) the refactored AI pipeline improves the efficiency and efficacy of AI-enabled mission-critical systems, (ii) it enables autonomous systems to be more responsive, while lowering their cost, and (iii) it contributes to safety of intelligent systems by ensuring that critical inputs are processed first. The project expects to demonstrate significant improvements in performance of modern machine-learning-based inference protocols, while offering service differentiation that dramatically improves predictability and timeliness of reactions to critical situations. If successful, the project will significantly reduce the cost of deploying machine intelligence solutions in future cyber-physical systems, while improving predictability and temporal guarantees. In addition to delivering the technical contributions of this project, an explicit purpose of the work is to advance education and workforce development on Intelligent CPS topics. This is achieved through interactions between activities for research, education, and broadening participation, as well as integration of multiple communities, including (i) researchers on embedded computing who offer platforms and schedulers, (ii) researchers on IoT and networking, and (iii) researchers on intelligent applications and application domain experts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Designers and general users can intuitively apply this framework for synthesizing a variety of immersive and engaging VR training scenarios in a fully automatic, fast, scalable, and low-cost manner. As a showcase of the proposed framework, the project will demonstrate how to synthesize personalized virtual training environments for workforce training, such as safety inspection training for employees, workplace supervisors, and safety inspectors. This research project offers a novel interdisciplinary perspective for generating personalized VR training content by bringing together expertise and insights from human-computer interaction, virtual reality, computer graphics, machine learning, and optimization, as well as domain expertise in instructional design, safety, emergency management, and engineering.

A VR station will be set up which is capable of tracking multimodal body data such as gaze, body pose, hand movement, and the locomotion of a trainee in performing tasks in a virtual workplace. Based on such tracked data, machine learning models are trained to analyze and characterize the trainee’s skill levels. (2) How to synthesize virtual environments for personalized training? Optimization approaches will be formulated for synthesizing realistic and highly immersive virtual environments for adaptively training the trainee considering his/her skill levels, preferences, and personal training goals. (3) How to evaluate VR training effects? The investigator will evaluate the effectiveness of the synthesized VR training experiences by comparing with alternative training approaches quantitatively in terms of performance gain and knowledge retention; and qualitatively by obtaining domain experts’ and participants’ feedback about the effectiveness, enjoyment, and engagement of the training experience. To facilitate easy deployment and widespread adoption of personalized VR training, the investigator will publicly disseminate the software tools and toolkits devised through project websites, workshops, and research papers. In addition, the investigator will disseminate the research by (1) setting up an open-access VR station at the George Mason University’s Makerspace where faculty, students, and staff from various disciplines can conveniently experience personalized VR training; (2) organizing interdisciplinary VR training workshops and demo days to disseminate the VR training research findings, to showcase the VR training demos to the public, and to stimulate the research and adoption of VR training in different disciplines; (3) broadening the participation of first-generation underrepresented undergraduate students in computing and VR training research via a series of focused mentoring activities organized in collaboration with the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program at the university.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to their promising security guarantees, the cryptographic protocols for MPC have gained unprecedented exposure in the last decade. With the proliferation of large, distributed systems and computations such as Tor and blockchain, there is an urgent need for large-scale MPC to ensure security and privacy for these applications. However, large-scale applications pose some unique challenges for the design of MPC protocols. There are thousands of parties, often with unequal resources, and a small number of parties are likely to fail during a protocol execution. This project proposes to design MPC protocols to address these challenges. The project’s novelties are the design of new MPC protocols satisfying the requirements of large-scale distributed applications. <br/><br/>Specifically, the investigators put forward a new framework for committee-based MPC for large-scale secure computations. These protocols distribute the computations across thousands of parallel committees to maximize the utilization of available resources for improved throughput. The designed protocols optimally choose committees and committee sub-protocols that optimize resource utilization and security. Additionally, they handle party failure and provide efficient oblivious access and search capabilities over data generated in these computations.  The team of researchers combines techniques from prior work on secure computation (MPC) and oblivious data structures to simultaneously achieve all of these goals. The project’s impacts are to enable new classes of privacy-preserving computation, analytics, and applications geared to the needs of real-world distributed systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
